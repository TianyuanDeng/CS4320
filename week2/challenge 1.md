### **Briefly Introduction**
China is a big country with long history, and there are 56 ethnics living in China now. Han Fu is referred to the traditional/historical dress of [*Han Chinese*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese) (majority ethnic in China with 92% of China's population, creators of most Chinese culture, local Chinese). Han Fu is the formal cloth of Chinese from the time of Yellow emperor to 17 century. When the [*Manchus Chinese*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people) (one of minority ethnic of China) established the Qing dynasty, in order to control Han Chinese more efficiently, the authorities  issued decrees having Han Chinese men to wear Manchurian attire and shave their hair into pigtails. Han Fu resuscitated after Xinhai Revolution(1912), and it is popular in youth at present.  Ancient Han Chinese clothing is influential to the clothing of such as the [*Japanese kimono*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimono "Kimono") and [*Korean hanbok*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanbok "Hanbok").[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanfu#cite_note-Evenson-4)

### **History**
From the beginning of its history, Han clothing (especially in elite circles) was inseparable from silk, supposedly discovered by the [Yellow Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Emperor)'s consort, Leizu. The [Shang Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_dynasty) (c. 1600 BC – 1000 BC), developed the rudiments of Hanfu; it consisted of a yi, a narrow-cuffed, knee-length tunic tied with a sash, and a narrow, ankle-length skirt, called chang, worn with a bixi, a length of fabric that reached the knees. Vivid primary colors and green were used, due to the degree of technology at the time.

The dynasty to follow the Shang, the [Western Zhou Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Zhou), established a strict hierarchical society that used clothing as a status meridian, and inevitably, the height of one’s rank influenced the ornateness of a costume. Such markers included the length of a skirt, the wideness of a sleeve and the degree of ornamentation. In addition to these class-oriented developments, Han Chinese clothing became looser, with the introduction of wide sleeves and jade decorations hung from the sash which served to keep the yi closed. The yi was essentially wrapped over, in a style known as jiaoling youren, or wrapping the right side over before the left, because of the initially greater challenge to the right-handed wearer (people of Zhongyuan discouraged left-handedness like many other historical cultures, considering it unnatural, barbarian, uncivilized, and unfortunate).
